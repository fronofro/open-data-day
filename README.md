# [OpenTransit](http://opentransit.city/) x [Open Data Day 2019](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-for-san-francisco-open-data-day-2019-tickets-56291530483)

Welcome to Open Data Day 2019! Today, we're going to give you a full day's worth of raw
data about the buses in San Francisco -- you'll know where every bus in the city was
every 15 seconds on October 15, 2018. It's 230 MB of raw, unprocessed open data.

Your challenge is to make something useful for San Franciscans with it.

To give you a taste of how the open data analysis process goes, we'll be giving snapshots
of our data at 3 stages in the process. You'll have three different challenges you can
take on, and we challenge you to improve upon the work we've done.

## Challenge 1: Calculating bus stops

Our raw data -- the location of each bus at each point in time -- isn't terribly
useful by itself.
