# Challenge 1: Processing Data

The raw data we'll give you includes:

1. Every GPS location of every Route 1 bus on 10/15/18.
1. Every GPS location of every Route 14 bus on 10/15/18.
1. Every GPS location of every Route 14 bus from 1/14/19 to 1/20/19.

Each dataset also includes the GPS coordinates of each stop on the
respective routes.

Feel free to use whatever data you like. It's probably easiest to start with one of the
first two datasets, since they're smaller. Can you figure out when each Route 1
or Route 14 bus reached each stop?
